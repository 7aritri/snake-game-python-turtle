# 🐍 Snake Game — Python Turtle
A classic Snake Game built using **Python** and the built-in **Turtle Graphics** module. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, game loops, collision detection, and object-oriented design using simple, easy-to-understand code.

## 🚀 Features
- Smooth snake movement controlled by arrow keys  
- Randomized food spawning  
- Snake grows when it eats food  
- Collision detection (walls & self-collision)  
- Score display and real-time updates  
- Simple, readable Python code suitable for beginners
